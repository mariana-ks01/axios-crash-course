# Axios Crash Course
Followed along a tutorial on axios requests. Complete with adding custom headers(local and global),
simultaneous requests, transforming the response, error handling, and cancelling a request.

> These are the files for the YouTube Axios crash course.

"start.js" is just the event listeners and empty functions. "main.js" is the completed code
